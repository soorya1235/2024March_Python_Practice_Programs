Data classes are especially useful when you need to create simple classes to hold data without a lot of boilerplate code.
They are a concise and convenient way to define classes for data storage.


Boilerplate Code Documentation

Overview
Boilerplate code is provided to serve as a foundation for building new components or features within the software project. It encapsulates commonly used structures, configurations, and setup procedures to streamline development and ensure consistency across the codebase.

Structure
The boilerplate code is organized into logical sections to facilitate understanding and modification. Here's an overview of the main components:

Imports: Includes statements importing necessary libraries, modules, or packages.

Configuration: Initializes variables, sets up environment configurations, and establishes connections to external services if required.

Structural Elements: Defines classes, functions, or other structural components needed for the feature or component.

Error Handling: Implements basic error handling mechanisms to handle exceptions gracefully.

Purpose
The purpose of the boilerplate code is to:

Reduce redundancy: By providing a standardized starting point for similar components or features, developers can avoid reinventing the wheel.
Enhance consistency: Ensures that common structures and conventions are maintained throughout the codebase, promoting readability and maintainability.
Accelerate development: Streamlines the process of setting up basic functionality, allowing developers to focus on implementing unique logic.
Usage
To utilize the boilerplate code effectively, follow these steps:

Identify the Use Case: Determine which part of the project requires the boilerplate code and ensure it aligns with the intended purpose.

Copy and Modify: Copy the relevant boilerplate code into the target file or module. Modify it as necessary to meet the specific requirements of the feature or component being developed.

Customization: If the boilerplate code includes configurable options, adjust them according to the needs of the project. Pay attention to comments or documentation within the code that highlight areas open for customization.

Integration: Integrate the customized boilerplate code into the larger codebase, ensuring compatibility with existing structures and dependencies.
