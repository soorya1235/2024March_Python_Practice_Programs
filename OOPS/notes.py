Boilerplate code can vary significantly based on the programming paradigm, language, and the tools/frameworks being used.
It often becomes more apparent in larger projects where similar patterns are repeated in different parts of the codebase. 
The goal is to reduce redundancy, improve code readability, and enhance maintainability. 
Boilerplate code can appear in various forms depending on the programming language, framework, or application structure.
Here are some common examples from different contexts: 
1.File opening and clsing normal way (boiler plate)
without boilerplate - > using the context manager.
2.Initializing classes with __ini__ method, without boilerplate using the dataclass
3.property validation -> use getters and setters.
